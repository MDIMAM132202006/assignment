    "Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies reality by modeling objects in a way that emphasizes what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction involves creating abstract classes and methods that serve as templates for concrete subclasses.\n",

    "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to the internal state of an object and enforces access through well-defined interfaces (methods). Encapsulation helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications."
