    "\n",
    "GET Method: It is one of the HTTP methods used for requesting data from a specified resource. When you use a GET request, the data is appended to the URL, making it visible in the address bar. GET requests are typically used for retrieving data from a server and should not be used for sensitive or confidential data because the data is visible in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method: It is another HTTP method used for sending data to the server to create or update a resource. Unlike GET, POST data is not visible in the URL, and it is sent in the request body. This method is commonly used for submitting forms and sending data that may include sensitive information, like passwords."

    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the 'request' object is used to access incoming data from the client or user. It allows you to retrieve form data, query parameters, files, and other information sent by a client's request. You can use the 'request' object to access and manipulate data in your Flask application, enabling you to handle user input, process forms, and respond to various client requests effectively."

    "Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'redirect()' function in Flask is used to redirect the client's browser to a different URL. It is commonly used in web applications to navigate users from one page to another or to perform a redirect after a form submission. For example, after successfully submitting a form, you can use redirect() to send the user to a \"Thank You\" page or a confirmation page. This helps manage the flow of user interactions within a web application."

    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates in Flask are used to generate dynamic HTML content that can be sent to the client's browser. They allow you to create web pages with placeholders for dynamic data, making it easier to produce consistent and dynamic web content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function is used to render these templates. It takes a template file as an argument, along with any data or variables you want to pass to the template. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to fill in the placeholders in the template with the provided data. This function simplifies the process of generating HTML pages that incorporate dynamic content, such as data from a database, form inputs, or other sources. It's a crucial component in building dynamic web applications with Flask."
