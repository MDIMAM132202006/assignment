    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It serves as a central repository for various types of data, allowing users and applications to interact with it for tasks such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases use structured, tabular data, while NoSQL databases can use diverse data models, offering more flexibility in accommodating different data formats.\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases can have dynamic or no schemas, allowing for easier adaptability to changing data requirements.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use the standardized SQL query language, while NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to their data models.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for better horizontal scalability and can handle large volumes of data across distributed systems more efficiently than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "Use Cases: SQL databases are suitable for applications with structured and well-defined data, such as financial systems. NoSQL databases are often used for applications with rapidly changing, unstructured, or semi-structured data, such as social media platforms or real-time analytics."

It refers to the primary key of another table and is used to maintain data integrity and enforce referential integrity between related tables. The foreign key constraint ensures that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table."
