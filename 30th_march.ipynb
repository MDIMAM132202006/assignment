    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: The coefficients of elastic net regression represent the linear relationship between the features and the target variable, adjusted by the regularization terms. The larger the absolute value of a coefficient, the stronger the effect of the corresponding feature on the target variable. The sign of a coefficient indicates the direction of the effect: positive for positive correlation, negative for negative correlation. The coefficients that are zero indicate that the corresponding features are not relevant for the model, and they are eliminated by the lasso penalty. Therefore, you can use the coefficients of elastic net regression to rank the features by their importance and select the ones that have non-zero coefficients."
